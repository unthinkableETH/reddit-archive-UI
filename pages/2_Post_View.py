There is so much implicit classism (and I'd say racism) in QCing people in the wild. It reproduces the same dynamics of elitist jerks who are "alarmed" that the uncouth masses wear brands they think as exclusive (see comments on LV demographic change for an example). I grew up in a country where the poor wore bad reps with pride. My mom would buy me awful reps and nobody thought anything of it. Moreover, nobody was under the impression that they were auth either. We just wore what we wore because we thought it was fashion. Now I can afford any auth of the reps I buy but I still have a fond memory of those terrible reps. My dad bought me my first Cartier watch rep when I was 14, like 30+ years ago. He had no clue what Cartier was but just thought I'd like it because it looked trendy. I feel weirdly protective of people who wear bad reps because that was once me and my family."
